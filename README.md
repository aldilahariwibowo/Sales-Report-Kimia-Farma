# Virtual Internship Experience: Big Data Analytics - Kimia Farma

VIX Big Data Analytics Kimia Farma is a virtual internship experience facilitated by Rakamin Academy. In this project, I played the role of a Project-Based Intern tasked with analyzing and creating sales reports for the company using the provided data. Through this project, I also learned a lot about data warehouse, data lake, and datamart.

Objectives
•	Creating datamart design (base tables and aggregate tables)
•	Creating visualizations/dashboard for company sales reports

Dataset consists of the following tables:
•	Sales
•	Products
•	Customers

# Base Table 

A base table is a table that contains the original or raw data collected from its source and includes the information needed to answer specific questions or solve particular problems. In this project, the base table is created by combining the sales, customers, and products tables with the primary key on invoice_id.

# Aggregate Table 

An aggregate table is a table created by collecting and calculating data from base tables. This aggregate table contains summarized information and is used to analyze data more quickly and efficiently. The results from this table will be used as a data source for creating the sales report dashboard.
